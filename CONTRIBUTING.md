## Coding guidelines

**Unit Testing**

Code should be unit tested with a near-100% coverage. This may not always be
completely feasible, but at least 90%+ should be targeted. However, Unit tests
should not just be done to achieve a high test coverage, writing useful tests
is even more important, just not as easily measurable. Unit tests should be
written using phpunit.

**Style**

We feel that a unified coding style is important, which is why we require a
linter to be used. In this case **phpcheckstyle** is used. The integrated
phpcheckstyle in .checkstyle should be used. As a convenience, lint.sh
can also be used.

In this project, we use tabs for indentation and use a maximum line length of
80 characters (assuming tab characters 4 spaces wide).

**Documentation**

All classes, methods and functions should be described using DocBlock comments.
docstring

Hard to understand parts of code within a method or function should always be
commented accordingly.
